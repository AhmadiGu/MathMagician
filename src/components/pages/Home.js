      What is the best definition of math?
      Mathematics is the science and study of quality, structure, space,
      and change. Mathematicians seek out patterns,
      formulate new conjectures, and establish truth by rigorous deduction
      from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions.

      Why math is important as a student?
      Mathematics provides an effective way of building mental discipline and encourages logical
      reasoning and mental rigor. In addition, mathematical knowledge plays a crucial role in
      understanding the contents of other school subjects such as science,
      social studies, and even music and art.
